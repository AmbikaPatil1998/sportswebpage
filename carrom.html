<p>Carrom is played with lightweight wooden discs which make up the Carrom men and Queen plus a heavier disc called a striker. There are nine Carrom men for each team or player plus one red piece called the Queen. Carrom is played by flicking the striker at the Carrom men to propel them into the pockets.</p>
