    <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).</p>

    <p><strong>Rules for playing badminton</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>The shuttlecock should not be carried on or come to rest on the racquet.</li>
        <li>A player should not reach over the net to hit the shuttlecock.</li>
        <li>A serve must carry cross court (diagonally) to be valid.</li>
        <li>During the serve, a player should not touch any of the lines of the court, until the server strikes the shuttlecock</li>
    </ol>
